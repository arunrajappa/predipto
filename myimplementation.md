# Implementation Plan: Football Tournament Prediction Game

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the development approach for a Football Tournament Prediction Game as described in the PRD. The plan follows an incremental development strategy through a series of MVPs (Minimum Viable Products), each building upon the previous one to deliver a complete, scalable solution.

## Guiding Principles
1. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on delivering core value to users early and iteratively
2. **Scalability**: Build with growth in mind from the beginning
3. **Modularity**: Create reusable components that can be extended in future MVPs
4. **Performance**: Ensure responsive experience across devices
5. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and data validation

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for type safety
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible schema design
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO
- **API Integration**: Football-Data.org or API-Football for match data
- **Hosting**: Vercel for frontend, Heroku for backend
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
